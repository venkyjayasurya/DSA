/*
* Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm
* in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not
* in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity
* are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
*
* Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
* Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
