/*
 * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm
 * in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not
 * in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity
 * are of ÎŸ(n^2) where n is the number of items.
 *
 * Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
 * Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
